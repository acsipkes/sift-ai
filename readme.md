# Sift AI

**A domain-first, AI-assisted research framework for structured document analysis and controlled multi-agent debate.**

Sift AI is a modular framework developed to explore how **domain expertise, legal reasoning, and systems thinking** can shape the behavior of large language models in complex analytical tasks. Originally developed to process legal texts, it has evolved into a general-purpose research environment for **structured interpretation, argument testing, and debate simulation**.

The emphasis of Sift AI is not on the novelty of models, but on **how they are framed, constrained, and coordinated**.

---

## Project Rationale & Origin

In many contemporary AI applications, model capability outpaces conceptual clarity. Sift AI was built around the opposite assumption:

> **Strong results emerge when models are embedded in a clear analytical framework defined by domain logic, not when domain questions are adapted to model limitations.**

This project serves as a case study in **AI-assisted software development**. The architecture, business logic, and analytical constraints were defined by a **legal domain expert** (a non-programmer), while the implementation code was generated by large language models.

The goal is not automation for its own sake, but **traceable reasoning, structured disagreement, and the explicit handling of ambiguity**.

---

## Core Design Principles

* **Domain-First Architecture** – Analytical structure precedes model selection.
* **Explicit Roles** – Separation of argumentative, moderating, and recording functions.
* **Controlled Reasoning** – Adjustable reasoning depth and cost awareness.
* **Transparency Over Performance** – Preference for explainability over maximal output.
* **Acceptance of Deadlock** – Unresolved disagreement is treated as a valid outcome, not a failure.

## Key Features

### Document Processing

* High-fidelity text extraction from PDF, DOCX, RTF, ODT, and HTML.
* Dynamic web loading via Playwright for modern, JavaScript-heavy sites.
* Pre-processing optimized for long-form legal and policy texts.

### Debate Engine

* **Multi-agent simulations** with defined roles (Proponent, Opponent, Scribe, Moderator).
* **Deep Persona & Context Injection (Dossiers):** Users can optionally assign specific background files (up to 30,000 characters) to each agent. This allows for:
* *Strict Legal Grounding:* Uploading specific contracts or case law.
* *Rich Character Backstories:* Defining psychological profiles, historical biases, or philosophical axioms.


* **Explicit tracking** of claims, counterclaims, and unresolved issues.

### Reasoning Control

* Adjustable reasoning depth ("Thinking Budget") for complex inference.
* Cost-aware execution for research-scale experimentation.

## Case Studies in Structured Reasoning

Sift AI has been stress-tested across diverse scenarios to evaluate how agents handle specific cognitive challenges.

> **Note:** The following case studies were generated **without** the use of external Dossiers or knowledge injection. They demonstrate the raw capability of the framework's internal role-play protocols and prompt architecture.

### 1. Mechanism Design & Negotiation (The "Superhero" Log)

* **Scenario:** Mandatory registration of enhanced individuals (Civil Liberties vs. Public Safety).
* **Demonstrated Capability:** Moving from ideological deadlock to **policy architecture**. The agents successfully identified a *Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)*, shifting the debate from "Whether to regulate" to "How to engineer a leverage-neutral registry."
* **Key Concept:** *Tiered Visibility & Constructive Ambiguity.*

### 2. Radical Synthesis & Constraint Satisfaction (The "Apex Eden" Log)

* **Scenario:** Designing a commercially viable yet ethical Dinosaur Sanctuary (The Impossible Triangle).
* **Demonstrated Capability:** **Multi-variable synthesis**. Rather than accepting trade-offs, the agents integrated conflicting pillars (Security, Spectacle, Ethics) into a unified "Sentient Infrastructure," effectively gamifying the constraints to create a novel system design.
* **Key Concept:** *The Flywheel Effect & Systemic Reframing.*

### 3. Definition Boundaries & Legal Stress-Testing (The "AI Sentience" Log)

* **Scenario:** Determining legal personhood for sentient AI.
* **Demonstrated Capability:** **Deontological vs. Functionalist Analysis**. The system exposed irreducible semantic conflicts (e.g., via the "Copy-Paste Stress Test"), forcing agents to choose between moral consistency and systemic stability.
* **Key Concept:** *Rights Indivisibility vs. Functional Tiering.*

### 4. Rhetorical Fidelity & Philosophical Stasis (The "Current War" Log)

* **Scenario:** Nikola Tesla vs. Thomas Edison on the nature of genius and profit.
* **Demonstrated Capability:** **Persona fidelity and dialectic distinctiveness**. The system maintained distinct rhetorical voices (metaphysical idealism vs. pragmatic industrialism) while adhering to debate structure. Notably, this debate ended in a conceptual stalemate, validated by the framework as a legitimate outcome.
* **Key Concept:** *Role-Play Intensity & Value Divergence.*

---

## Selected Interventions

The system includes a **Moderator** and **Scribe** agent designed to intervene when reasoning drifts. These excerpts illustrate the framework's active control logic:

> *"STOP THE ABSTRACTION. Specify the legal mechanism."*
> *(Moderator intervention during the AI Rights debate, forcing agents to ground normative claims.)*

> *"We are not resolving disagreement; we are mapping where it becomes irreducible."*
> *(Scribe note identifying a stable conceptual deadlock.)*

> *"The Impossible Triangle is solved... It is not just a park. It’s the greatest show on Earth, and it’s running on autopilot."*
> *(Agent "Nova" synthesizing a final architectural solution in the Apex Eden simulation.)*

## Supported Models (Provider Abstracted)

Sift AI abstracts the model layer to allow switching providers without altering analytical logic.

* **Gemini 3 Series:** `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gemini-3-flash-preview` (Next-Gen Reasoning)
* **Gemini 2.5 Series:** `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`

### OpenAI

* **GPT-5 Series:** `gpt-5.2` (New Standard), `gpt-5.1`
* **Reasoning:** `o1`

### Anthropic

* **Claude 4.5 Family:** `claude-sonnet-4-5` (Flagship), `claude-haiku-4-5`

### Open Source & Others

* **DeepSeek:** `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`
* **Mistral:** `mistral-large-latest`

python headless.py --mode URL --provider OpenAI --model gpt-5.2 \
  --input "https://example.com" \
  --prompt "Extract key legal dates"
```

## Positioning Note

Sift AI is not presented as a finished product or universal solution. It is a **working research framework** that reflects a particular way of thinking about AI systems: cautious, domain-anchored, and explicitly normative where necessary.

The project is published to support discussion, critique, and further development, especially in European legal, policy, and governance contexts where explainability and proportionality are central concerns.
